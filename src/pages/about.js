            (with a heart of gold) I get distracted by styling when I should be
            content writing. But that's ok. I am not a content writer. Or
            prosaic. I am a web developer. I like to make clean UX and restful
            API content. I like solving problems with legible, modular code with
            clear organization and the future in mind.

          <h3>motivations and goals</h3>
          While I draw on my past experience I am at heart a neophile, driven to
          experience what I find new, challenging, or both. I desire primarily
          to engage in opportunities that push me to expand my skillsets and
          continue to grow.

          <h3>history</h3>
          <p>
            Beginning in my teenage years, I spent 14 years in the culinary
            industry, where I worked everything from scullion to sous chef.
            Those years taught me that making time management, team work,
            accountability, and dedication top priorities always pays off.
